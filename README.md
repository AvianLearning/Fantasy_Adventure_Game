Model Fantasy Adventure Lab with Iain and Jenken. All Day lab


The task is to model a fantasy adventure. The game will have players, who will have a number of health points and weapons/spells. Players will fall into different categories:

* Dwarves, Barbarians, Knights
	* each of these will have a weapon and fight with other players (Sword, Axe, Club, etc)
	* should be able to change their weapon at any point in the game.
* Warlocks and Wizards
	* they will be able to cast spells on others (Fireball, Lightning Strike, etc).
	* they will have a mythical creature (e.g. Ogre, Dragon) who will defend them from attackers.
	* should be able to change spells or creature at any point in the game.
* Clerics
	* they will have healing tools with which they can heal other players (potion, herbs, etc).
	* should be able to change healing tool at any point in the game.

The game will also have rooms to work through. Each room should either have some kind of treasure (Gold, Gems) to collect or an Enemy (Troll, Orc) to defeat before moving on.
